				<p> I'm currently a Data Scientist on a research team at Amazon. Before that, I held Data Scientist roles in consulting/start-ups. 
				 And before that, I was getting destroyed in my statistics & computer science courses at UC Berkeley. 
				 <br /><br />
				 I like creative coding, data visualization, statistics, and contributing to open-source.
				 <br/><br/>
				 Outside of work I enjoy surfing, foosball, fitness, and skateboarding. Big fan of yoga as well, though I'm pretty trash at it. 
				 Oh well, one savasana at a time. 
				 <br/>
				 Namaste, haters.

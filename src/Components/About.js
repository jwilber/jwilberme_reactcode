				<p> I currently work as a Data Scientist at a consulting company. Before that I worked as a Data Scientist for a start-up. 
				 And before that, I was getting destroyed in my statistics & computer science courses at UC Berkeley. 
				 <br /><br />
				 I like creative coding, data visualization, and contributing to open-source.
				 <br/><br/>
				 Outside of work I enjoy surfing, foosball, fitness, and skateboarding. Big fan of yoga as well, though I'm pretty trash at it. 
				 Oh well, one savasana at a time. 
				 <br />
				 Namaste, haters.
